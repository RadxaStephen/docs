## Boot Firmware

The Dragon Q6A comes with the SPI boot firmware pre-flashed by default. Under normal circumstances, it is not necessary to re-flash the boot firmware. If the system fails to boot properly, you can try re-flashing the SPI boot firmware.

For detailed steps on flashing the SPI boot firmware, please refer to the [Flashing SPI Boot Firmware](../q6a/low-dev/spi_fw/) tutorial.
