This guide explains how to install the system to eMMC using the `dd` command.

:::warning
Installing the system will format the eMMC module. Please back up any important data in advance!
:::

## Prerequisites

To use the `dd` command to install the system to eMMC, you need to meet the following conditions:

- The system can boot normally from another storage device (recommended: use a MicroSD card to boot the system)
- The eMMC module is installed on the motherboard or the motherboard has onboard eMMC

## Hardware Connection

You can proceed according to your motherboard configuration.

:::tip
This tutorial is applicable to multiple motherboards. Choose the corresponding steps for hardware connection based on your motherboard configuration.

For motherboards with onboard eMMC, there is no eMMC module interface, so no installation is required.

eMMC Module Installation Steps:

1. Observe the notch direction on the eMMC module and the notch marking on the motherboard's eMMC module interface to determine the correct installation orientation.
2. Place the eMMC module above the motherboard's eMMC module interface, ensuring the eMMC module interface is properly aligned with the motherboard's eMMC module interface.
3. Gently press one end of the eMMC module until you hear a "click" sound, then press the other end in the same way to ensure the eMMC module is properly installed.

## System Installation

### Download System Image

Access the resource summary download page to download the system image file to your local device.

:::tip Image Note
The downloaded system image is a compressed file and needs to be extracted before use!
:::

#### Recommended Download Methods

- Direct Download

Access the resource summary download page directly from your device to download the system image file.

- Download using wget

Download the system image file to your device using the `wget` command.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update &&
sudo apt install wget -y
wget <url>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<url>` is the download address of the system image file. You can replace it with the download address from the resource summary page.

- PC Download

Access the resource summary download page from a PC, download the system image file, and then transfer it to the device using a USB drive, FTP, SCP, or other methods.

#### Extract System Image

Our system images are generally in `*.img.xz` format and need to be extracted before use.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xz-utils -y
unxz <image_path>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Where `<image_path>` is the path to the system image file, which should be replaced with the actual system image file path.

### Install System Image

Use the `dd` command to install the system image to eMMC.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
sudo dd if=<image_path> of=<device_target> bs=4M status=progress
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Parameter Description:

- `<image_path>`: The path to the system image file, which should be replaced with the actual path.
- `<device_target>`: The device path of the eMMC module, which should be replaced with the actual eMMC module device path.
- `bs=4M`: Block size for writing.
- `status=progress`: Show writing progress.

:::tip Determining Device Path

You can use the `lsblk` command to view device paths and determine the correct path based on disk capacity.

Note: If the disk capacities are similar, you can safely unplug and replug the device (applicable to eMMC modules) to observe the appearance and disappearance of device paths to determine the correct device path.

<NewCodeBlock tip="radxa@device$" type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>
