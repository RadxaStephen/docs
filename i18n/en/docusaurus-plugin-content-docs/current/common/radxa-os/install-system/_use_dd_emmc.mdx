This document explains how to install the system to eMMC using the `dd` command.

:::warning
Installing the system will format the eMMC module. Please back up important data in advance!
:::

## Prerequisites

You need to meet the following conditions to install the system to eMMC using the `dd` command:

- The system can boot normally via another boot medium. It is recommended to boot the system from a MicroSD card.
- The eMMC module is installed on the board, or the board itself has onboard eMMC.

## Hardware Connection


<Tabs queryString="system boot">
<TabItem value="eMMC Module" default={props.tag === "emmc_module"} attributes={{className: props.tag === "emmc_board" && "tab_none"}} >

### Steps to install the eMMC module:

1. Check the notch orientation on the eMMC module and the notch marking on the eMMC connector on the board to determine the correct installation direction.
2. Place the eMMC module above the board's eMMC connector, ensuring the connectors are roughly aligned.
3. Press down on one end of the eMMC module with slight force. A "click" sound indicates a successful insertion. Then press the other end in the same way to ensure the eMMC module is fully seated.

<TabItem value="Onboard eMMC" default={props.tag === "emmc_board"} attributes={{className: props.tag === "emmc_module" && "tab_none"}} >

If your board is the version with onboard eMMC, no installation is required.

## Install the System

### Download the System Image

On the board, visit the [Resources Download](../../download) page and download the system image file locally.

:::tip Image Note
The downloaded system image is a compressed file. You need to extract it before use!
:::

You can use the `wget` command to download the system image file to the board.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget -y
wget <download_url>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Here, `<download_url>` is the download address of the system image file. You can copy the image download link from the [Resources Download](../../download) page and replace it.

Download example: <code>{`wget ${props?.download_url ?? '<download_url>'}`}</code>

#### Extract the System Image

Our system images are usually in the `*.img.xz` format and must be extracted before use.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo apt install xz-utils -y
unxz <path_to_image_unxz>
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Here, `<path_to_image_unxz>` is the path to the system image file. Replace it with the actual path.

Extraction example:

<code>{`unxz ${props?.path_to_image_unxz ?? "<path_to_image_unxz>"}`}</code>

### Identify the Device Path

You can use the `lsblk` command to view device paths and determine the correct one based on disk capacity.

Note: If the disk capacities are very similar, you can safely hot-plug (applies to an eMMC module) to observe which device path appears and disappears to determine the correct device.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>

If the eMMC device is recognized, it is usually shown as a `/dev/mmcblk*` device.

Example terminal output:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
mmcblk0     179:0    0    58G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0    16M  0 part /config
├─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0   300M  0 part /boot/efi
└─mmcblk0p3 179:3    0  57.6G  0 part /
zram0       254:0    0 982.6M  0 disk [SWAP]
mmcblk1     179:0    0    58G  0 disk
```

### Install the System Image

Use the `dd` command to write the system image to the eMMC.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
sudo dd if=<path_to_image> of=<device_target> bs=4M status=progress
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Write example:

<code>{`sudo dd if=${
  props?.path_to_image ?? "<path_to_image>"
} of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=4M status=progress`}</code>

Parameter description:

- `<path_to_image>`: The path to the system image file. Replace it with the actual path.
- `<device_target>`: The device path of the eMMC module. Replace it with the actual eMMC device path.
- `bs=4M`: Block size for writing.
- `status=progress`: Show write progress.

### Verify the Write Result

After installation, use the `lsblk` command to check whether the partition table on the eMMC has been created correctly.

<NewCodeBlock tip={`radxa@${props?.board ?? 'device'}$`} type="device">

```
lsblk
```

</NewCodeBlock>

Example terminal output:

```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
mmcblk0     179:0    0    58G  0 disk
├─mmcblk0p1 179:1    0    16M  0 part /config
├─mmcblk0p2 179:2    0   300M  0 part /boot/efi
└─mmcblk0p3 179:3    0  57.6G  0 part /
zram0       254:0    0 982.6M  0 disk [SWAP]
mmcblk1     179:0    0    58G  0 disk
├─mmcblk1p1 179:1    0    16M  0 part
├─mmcblk1p2 179:2    0   300M  0 part
└─mmcblk1p3 179:3    0  57.6G  0 part
```
